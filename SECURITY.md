# Pessimism Security Policy

## Reporting a Security Bug
If you think you have discovered a security issue within any part of this codebase, please let us know. We take security bugs seriously; upon investigating and confirming one, we will patch it within a reasonable amount of time, and ultimately release a public security bulletin, in which we discuss the impact and credit the discoverer.

At present, due to the experimental and in-development nature of the _Pessimism_ project, the Coinbase HackerOne bug bounty program will not be used for vulnerability submission yet. Following the official release of a major version, the HackerOne bug bounty program will also be used for vulnerability submission. 

The only way to currently submit a confidential security bug is through [GitHub](https://github.com/base-org/pessimism/security/advisories).
