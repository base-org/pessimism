## Pessimism API

### Overview
The Pessimism API is a RESTful HTTP API that allows users to interact with the Pessimism application. The API is built using the [go-chi](https://github.com/go-chi/chi) framework and is served using the native [http package](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http). The API is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for the addition of new endpoints and functionality with relative ease.

Currently, interactive endpoint documentation is hosted via [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) at [https://base-org.github.io/pessimism/](https://base-org.github.io/pessimism/).
