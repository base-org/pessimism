# Contributing to Pessimism

## Code of Conduct

All interactions with this project follow our [Code of Conduct][code-of-conduct].
By participating, you are expected to honor this code. Violators can be banned
from further participation in this project, or potentially all Base and/or
Coinbase projects.

[code-of-conduct]: https://github.com/coinbase/code-of-conduct

## Before You Start

Ensure that you have read and understand the project's README file and the 
contribution guidelines. Search the issues tracker to see if the issue you
want to work on has already been reported or if someone is already working
on it. If you find an existing issue that you would like to work on, request
to be assigned to the issue. If you cannot find an existing issue that matches
what you want to work on, create a new issue and wait for it to be assigned to 
you before starting work on it.

## Bug Reports

* Ensure your issue [has not already been reported][1]. It may already be fixed!
* Include the steps you carried out to produce the problem.
* Include the behavior you observed along with the behavior you expected, and
  why you expected it.
* Include any relevant stack traces or debugging output.

## Feature Requests

We welcome feedback with or without pull requests. If you have an idea for how
to improve the project, great! All we ask is that you take the time to write a
clear and concise explanation of what need you are trying to solve. If you have
thoughts on _how_ it can be solved, include those too!

The best way to see a feature added, however, is to submit a pull request.

## Pull Requests

* Before creating your pull request, it's usually worth asking if the code
  you're planning on writing will actually be considered for merging. You can
  do this by [opening an issue][1] and asking. It may also help give the
  maintainers context for when the time comes to review your code.

* Ensure your [commit messages are well-written][2]. This can double as your
  pull request message, so it pays to take the time to write a clear message.

* Add tests for your feature. You should be able to look at other tests for
  examples. If you're unsure, don't hesitate to [open an issue][1] and ask!

* Ensure that your code is well-documented and meets the project's coding standards.

* Provide a reference to the issue you worked on and provide a brief description of the
  changes you made.

* Submit your pull request!

## Contributing to an Existing Issue

If you have been assigned an issue, please confirm that the issue is still open 
and has not already been resolved. If you have any questions about the issue,
please ask on the issue thread before starting work on it. Once you are assigned
to an issue, you can start working on a solution for it. Please note that it
is important to communicate regularly with the project maintainers and update
them on your progress. If you are no longer able to work on an issue, please 
let us know as soon as possible so we can reassign it.

## Support Requests

For security reasons, any communication referencing support tickets for Coinbase
products will be ignored. The request will have its content redacted and will
be locked to prevent further discussion.

All support requests must be made via [our support team][3].
