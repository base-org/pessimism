# pessimism
__Because you can't always be optimistic__

_Pessimism_ is a public good monitoring service that allows for [Op-Stack](https://stack.optimism.io/) and EVM compatible blockchains to be continously assessed for real-time threats using customly defined user invariant rulesets. To learn about Pessimism's architecture, please advise the documentation.

**Warning:**
Pessimism is currently experimental and very much in development. It means Pessimism is currently unstable, so code will change and builds can break over the coming months. If you come across problems, it would help greatly to open issues so that we can fix them as quickly as possible.

## Setup
To use the template, run the following the command(s):
1. Create local config file (`config.env`) to store all necessary environmental variables. There's already an example `config.env.template` in the repo that stores default env vars.

2. [Download](https://go.dev/doc/install) or upgrade to `golang 1.19`.

3. Install all project golang dependencies by running `go mod download`.

# To Run
1. Compile pessimism to machine binary by running the following project level command(s):
    * Using Make: `make build-app`

2. To run the compiled binary, you can use the following project level command(s):
    * Using Make: `make run-app`
    * Direct Call: `./bin/pessimism`

## Linting
[golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/) is used to perform code linting. Configurations are defined in [.golangci.yml](./.golangci.yml)
It can be ran using the following project level command(s):
* Using Make: `make lint`
* Direct Call: `golangci-lint run`

## Testing

### Unit Tests
Unit tests are written using the native [go test](https://pkg.go.dev/testing) library with test mocks generated using the golang native [mock](https://github.com/golang/mock) library.

Unit tests can ran using the following project level command(s):
* Using Make: `make test`
* Direct Call: `go test ./...`

### Integration Tests
TBD

## Spawning an invariant session

### Balance Enforcement Curl Example
The following curl command can be used to spawn a `balance_enforcement` invariant session on the `layer1` network. The invariant will check the balance of the address `0xfC0157aA4F5DB7177830ACddB3D5a9BB5BE9cc5e` every 10 blocks and alert to slack if the balance is ever less than 1 or greater than 2.

```
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:8080/v0/invariant' \
--header 'Content-Type: text/plain' \
--data-raw '{
  "method": "run",
  "params": {
    "network": "layer1",
    "pipeline_type": "live",
    "type": "balance_enforcement", 
    "start_height": null,
    "alert_destination": "slack",
    "invariant_params": {
        "address": "0xfC0157aA4F5DB7177830ACddB3D5a9BB5BE9cc5e",
        "lower": 1,
        "upper": 2
   }
}
}'
```

Which should return something like:
```
{
    "status_code" : 202,
    "status" : "OK",
    "result" : {
        "suuid" : "layer1:live:balance_enforcement::1631991901901231381836998",
    },
}
```
