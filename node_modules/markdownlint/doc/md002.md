# ~~`MD002` - First heading should be a top-level heading~~

> This rule is deprecated and provided for backward-compatibility

Tags: `headers`, `headings`

Aliases: `first-header-h1`, `first-heading-h1`

Parameters:

- `level`: Heading level (`integer`, default `1`)

> Note: *MD002 has been deprecated and is disabled by default.*
> [MD041/first-line-heading](md041.md) offers an improved implementation.

This rule is intended to ensure document headings start at the top level and
is triggered when the first heading in the document isn't an h1 heading:

```markdown
## This isn't an H1 heading

### Another heading
```

The first heading in the document should be an h1 heading:

```markdown
# Start with an H1 heading

## Then use an H2 for subsections
```

Note: The `level` parameter can be used to change the top-level (ex: to h2) in
cases where an h1 is added externally.

Rationale: The top-level heading often acts as the title of a document. More
